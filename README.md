# Rails Travel Journal With JS (Flatiron School Portfolio Project 4 of 5)

The original app allows a user to keep track of travels with short, bullet-journal-style entries and was built using Ruby on Rails, with Bootstrap (https://getbootstrap.com/) and Bootswatch (https://bootswatch.com/) styling templates. For this project, I added a JavaScript frontend.
